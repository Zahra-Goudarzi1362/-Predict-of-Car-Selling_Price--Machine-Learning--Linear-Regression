we want to Predict the Car Selling_Price besed on the various input through Machine Learning- Linear Regression.
we did some preprocessing on data related to delete some columns or change them. 
# we replace the numerical data with integer
THen I creat my model which R2 Score was 0.84, Then I tried to improve my model to better one by  various method.
THe first way to improve my model was adding some dimention  to my model and I checked R2 score. Three of features were added to data as they incresed R2 score 
The biggest correlation was for Present Price, so we enter following features that were effective in the past section to improve our model.
Finally we get R2 score 0.98.. was so nice. 
Thn we enter out data to get selling price.
